[CS:GO] End of Match - Stuck!

```
	*update 18.07.2021 - Load base map de_dust2 rather than the same workshop map if map stuck error happen.

Sometimes next map not start load and you are literally stuck, at end of match.
- Could happens when you try load workshop map but some reason you have no -authkey set on server or some error with that. (I have tested plugin this way only).

This plugin help you load de_dust2 map.

No commands, no cvars. Just add plugin in server.
