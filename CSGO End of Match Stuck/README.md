[CS:GO] End of Match - Stuck!

```
Sometimes next map not start load and you are literally stuck, at end of match.
- Could happens when you try load workshop map but some reason you have no -authkey set on server or some error with that. (I have tested plugin this way only).

This plugin help you load same map gain.

No commands, no cvars. Just add plugin in server.
