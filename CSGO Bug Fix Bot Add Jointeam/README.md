[CS:GO] bug fix - bot add jointeam

```
In CS:GO, when in-game fast respawn system is active (warmup, deathmatch, etc. etc.)
there is chance, you are going to get more bots in your game.
Even bot_quota 0 not help in this situation, as matter of fact, value of bot_quota also change by this bug.

This plugin prevent this bug. (But I think Valve should fix it after all...)

No commands, no cvars. Just add plugin in server.
